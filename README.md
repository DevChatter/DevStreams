## Getting Started

This project is a designed to provide people with information about software development streams on any streaming platform. It will help viewers find streams to watch, and will help streamers schedule their streams effectively. We want to show data in a calendar interface to allow users to see what streams are happening in the future, in addition to who is live right now.
